I believe just like the many flaws I have as a human, I do also have many strengths. I believe three of the major strengths I have is time management, organization, & communication. 
Alongside having these major points as my strengths, I believe they indeed go hand in hand with another. 
I like to keep track of things and when they need to get done, I also like to have a specific timelines on projects so that I can remain as organized as possible. 
This personally helps me so that I don’t create confusion in my work space and I can continue to constantly create a fluid work environment. 
With all of these things in play, I find it much more effortless to communicate with my team mates. 
Whether I am asking, answering, or researching unanswered questions, communication is a major key that falls into the pieces of my mind that I call my strengths. 

I have many values that I choose to live by, some of which are maintaining strong relationships with people, as well as the protection of people and organizations. 
Maintaining strong relationship goes without a doubt hand in hand in the professional world, as well as your personal world. 
Whether you have a good relationship with your neighbor and they are reliable in many situations, 
or you maintain strong relationships with your peers at work which will very much so help you in the long run. 
Maintaining strong relationships gives you the opportunity to learn, and create a work environment that allows everyone to enjoy being in a well versed work environment. 
The protection of people and organizations is one of the major reason why I wanted to be apart of the Cybersecurity field. 
This field is constantly growing at a heightened rate, and with that development the enemy is also growing at an exponential rate. 
This field gives me an opportunity to serve and protect the assets of many innocent people so that they can continue to enjoy a life of no worries. 
I can help protect organizations from falling and help my peers learn to grow in the process as well. 

Ever since I can remember, the world of cybersecurity has held a special fascination for me. 
It's not just a career path; it's a dynamic realm where every challenge is an invitation to unravel complex puzzles. 
My interest in cybersecurity is deeply rooted in a lifelong curiosity and an innate love for understanding the intricate systems that power our digital world.
Growing up, I found myself drawn to video games not just for the sheer enjoyment but for the intricate codes and algorithms that made them tick. 
This fascination with the digital realm naturally evolved into a keen interest in cybersecurity. 
Much like navigating through the intricate landscapes of a video game, the complexity of cybersecurity intrigues me. 
It's a world where each code is a piece of a puzzle, and unraveling it requires a combination of analytical thinking and creative problem-solving—qualities that I've honed through countless hours of gaming.
What truly excites me about cybersecurity is the collaborative aspect of the field. 
Just as in a multiplayer video game, where success hinges on effective teamwork, cybersecurity projects demand seamless collaboration. 
I thrive in such environments, enjoying the synergy that arises when individuals with diverse skills come together to tackle a common challenge. 
Whether it's dissecting a malware attack or devising a robust security strategy, the collective effort in the realm of cybersecurity is what makes the victories all the more satisfying.
Moreover, I find immense gratification in being part of an industry that is not only constantly growing but also perpetually evolving. 
Cyber threats are dynamic, and staying ahead requires a commitment to lifelong learning—an aspect of the field that resonates deeply with me. 
I relish the idea of being at the forefront of technological advancements, absorbing new knowledge, and adapting strategies to counter emerging threats. 
It's a journey of continuous improvement and a quest for mastery that aligns seamlessly with my personal and professional aspirations.
In essence, cybersecurity isn't just a career choice for me; it's a passion. 
It's the excitement of uncovering the unknown, the thrill of outsmarting digital adversaries, and the satisfaction of contributing to a field that safeguards the very foundation of our interconnected world. 
I am not just seeking a job; I am eager to immerse myself in a field that aligns with my intrinsic interests and allows me to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity.
